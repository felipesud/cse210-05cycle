Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```
